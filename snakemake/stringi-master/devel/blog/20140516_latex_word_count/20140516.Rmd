Counting the number of words in a LaTeX file with stringi
=========================================================

In my [recent post](http://www.rexamine.com/2014/05/stringi-0-2-3-released/)
I promised to present the most interesting features of the
[`stringi`](http://stringi.rexamine.com) package in more detail.

Here's one of such jolly features. Many LaTeX users/writers
may find it very useful.

### Loading a text file with encoding auto-detection ###

[Here](http://www.rexamine.com/manual_upload/powrot_taty_latin2.tex)'s a
LaTeX document consisting of a Polish poem. Probably, most of you wouldn't
have been able to guess the file's character encoding if I hadn't
left some hints. But it's OK, we have a little challenge.

Let's use some (currently experimental) `stringi` functions to guess the
file's encoding.

First of all, we should read the file as a raw vector
(anyway, each text file is a sequence of bytes).

```{r,cache=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(stringi)
```

```{r,powrot1,cache=TRUE}
 # experimental function (as per stringi_0.2-5):
download.file("http://www.rexamine.com/manual_upload/powrot_taty_latin2.tex",
   dest="powrot_taty_latin2.tex")
file <- stri_read_raw("powrot_taty_latin2.tex")
head(file, 15)
```

Let's try to detect the file's character encoding automatically.

```{r,powrot2,dependson='powrot1'}
stri_enc_detect(file)[[1]] # experimental function
```

Encoding detection is, at best, an imprecise operation using statistics
and heuristics. [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) indicates that
most probably we deal with Polish text in ISO-8859-2 (a.k.a. latin2) here.
What a coincidence: it's true.

Let's re-encode the file. Our target encoding will be UTF-8,
as it is a ``superset'' of all 8-bit encodings.
We really love portable code:

```{r,powrot3,dependson='powrot2'}
file <- stri_conv(file, stri_enc_detect(file)[[1]]$Encoding[1], "UTF-8")
file <- stri_split_lines1(file) # split a string into text lines
print(file[22:28]) # text sample
```

Of course, if we knew *a priori* that the file is in ISO-8859-2, we'd just call:

```{r,cache=TRUE}
file <- stri_conv(
   readLines("http://www.rexamine.com/manual_upload/powrot_taty_latin2.tex"),
   "ISO-8859-2", "UTF-8"
)
```

So far so good.



### Word count ###

LaTeX word counting is a quite complicated task
and [there are many possible approaches](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/534/)
to perform it. Most often, they rely on running some external tools
(which may be a bit inconvenient for some users).
Personally, I've always been most satisfied with the output produced
by the [Kile](http://kile.sourceforge.net/) LaTeX IDE for
KDE desktop environment.

![LaTeX document statistics in Kile](http://www.rexamine.com/manual_upload/kile_latex_stats.png "LaTeX document statistics in Kile")

As not everyone has Kile installed, I've had decided to grab Kile's algorithm
(the power of open source!), made some not-too-invasive `stringi`-specific
tweaks and here we are:

```{r,powrot4,dependson='powrot3'}
stri_stats_latex(file)
```


Some other aggregates are also available (they are meaningful in case
of any text file):

```{r,powrot5,dependson='powrot4'}
stri_stats_general(file)
```


Finally, here's the word count for my
[R programming book](http://rksiazka.rexamine.com) (in Polish).
Importantly, each chapter is stored in a separate `.tex` file
(there are 30 files), so "clicking out" the answer in Kile
would be a bit problematic:

```{r,eval=FALSE,tidy=FALSE}
apply(
   sapply(
      list.files(path="~/Publikacje/ProgramowanieR/rozdzialy/",
         pattern=glob2rx("*.tex"), recursive=TRUE, full.names=TRUE),
      function(x)
      stri_stats_latex(readLines(x))
   ), 1, sum)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
cat("CharsWord CharsCmdEnvir    CharsWhite         Words          Cmds        Envirs\n")
cat("   718755        458403        281989        120202         37055          6119\n")
```

Notably, my publisher was satisfied with the above estimate. :-)

Next time we'll take a look at ICU's very powerful transliteration services.
