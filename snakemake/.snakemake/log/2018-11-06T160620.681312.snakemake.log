Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 221 of /Users/Mahmoud.Hallal/Desktop/PhD/Generalized_pipeline/snakemake/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/Users/Mahmoud.Hallal/Desktop/PhD/Generalized_pipeline/results/Material_for_waterfall_0.01FDR_0.01P_MOLM13.Rda
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
